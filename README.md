## Introducing the Lazy Approach to Programming

This section describes in detail the different means and possible methods that can help you as a developer be lazy and get the work done. I have to warn you that this works only when there is a deadline. If deadlines don't exist, the methods won't work as with your programs, deadlines serve as your exit function or command.

The mathematics here includes algebra, calculus and mathematical induction.

### Learn Algorithm and Data Structure

Here, you get to understand the basics and probably the intricacies of how to design better algorithms and use the right data structures to build your small, medium or big softwares.
