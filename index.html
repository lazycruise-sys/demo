        <h1>building the future with go and php</h1>
        <p>i love to try new things but this newfound adventure of building softwaresfor me is the beginning of the future.</p>
        <p>it follows the same design principles as with mechanical engineering which I still love, but do not find interesting at the moment due to non-access to the tools and people that can help me achieve the things I have in mind. therefore, for the time being, i would make do with php, go and probably typescript.</p>
        <h2>welcome to programming cruise</h2>
        <p>learning go is the first part and understanding the details of the language is important to drive down this road</p>
